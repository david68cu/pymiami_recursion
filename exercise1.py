""" 
Exercise 1: Write a recursive function count_multiples(a, b) that counts 
how many multiples of a are part of the factorization of the number b. 
For example:

 >>> count_multiples(2, 4)     # 2 * 2 = 4
 1
 >>> count_multiples(2, 12)    # 2 * 2 * 3 = 12
 2
 >>> count_multiples(3, 11664)
 6
 >>>

This send the state to any new call
here we print the stack to see how the function s get accumulated there
